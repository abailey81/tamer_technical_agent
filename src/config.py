Configuration Module for Fundamental Analyst Agent

This module centralizes all configuration constants, field mappings,
validation thresholds, and settings used throughout the analysis pipeline.

All "magic numbers" and configuration values are defined here to ensure:
1. Single source of truth for all constants
2. Easy modification without touching analysis code
3. Transparency in assumptions and thresholds
4. Consistency across all modules
